Hey guys - today let's discuss Google Stadia.

_**FULL DISCLOSURE:** I received my Stadia controller and a Chromecast Ultra to keep for **free** thanks to my YouTube Premium subscription as part of a **publicly available** offer from Google. My thoughts are my own, I **am not** being paid to say anything and nobody is reviewing this post before it goes live._

Stadia actually surprised me. I'd seen reviews all over the internet of people saying Google Stadia basically sucked - but that wasn't my experience. I purchased a few paid games and claimed some free ones from Stadia Pro and I have to be honest - I *enjoyed* the experience. When my meme-worthy Sky Broadband would hold out, I could spend an hour or more playing Stadia and forget I was streaming the game. I particularly played Destiny 2 and Sniper Elite 4 quite a bit in 1080p (I'm a Plebian and don't own a 4K TV :laughing:).

That being said, Stadia's problem isn't Stadia itself; it's broadband. Sky Broadband is one of the most popular in the UK and it tends to have brown-outs where it'll lose connection for a few seconds on a regular basis. This is **really** annoying with newer games that require you to be online at all times - I can't tell you how many times I've been kicked out of Ghost Recon: Breakpoint mid-firefight because of my broadband.

This isn't so much a problem in the UK, but I'm under the impression that US broadband often has usage caps and that would be a major problem for someone wanting to stream games in 4K HDR (where Stadia shines).

In general, I actually *recommend* that you try Google Stadia if you don't want to shell out for expensive consoles (I'm looking at you, PS5 and Xbox Series X) or Gaming PC. However, it's important to realise that most people will need to upgrade their broadband to get smooth and reliable experience, especially at 4K.
