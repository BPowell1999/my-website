Hey everyone - 2020 has come to an end and 2021 has barged in - and I have some explaining to do.

I haven't maintained my website for a long time. My Twitter account has been axed and the name of my blog has been changed, among other things.

I'm not going to dance around the issues here - suffice it to say that 2020 absolutely *sucked* for me. A lot happened and it's changed me in ways that I'm still discovering. That's why I took a break over the holiday season. My hope was that it'd help and in some ways it did. I deleted my Twitter simply because I didn't use it and I wanted to focus on my website itself (eventually, apparently).

However, 2021 is afoot, and motivation has reintroduced itself to me so I'm going to be working on my website once again - for real this time. Here's my plan from now up until May;

## Stage 1: Catch-up

My web server has gone unattended for a long time. When I came back to it, it wasn't working - my website was down. I have no idea how long that was for, but it's running again now. In the same vein; there are many software updates that are needed, HTTPS certificates need renewal, etc.

So, step 1 is to get everything up-to-date and make a new post (this one). I'll have this done by the end of today (8th February).

## Stage 2: Fixes & changes

I've noticed a few errors around my site -  spelling oopsies, missed words, etc. I am going to go around all my pages and correct things like that and update any old and inaccurate info. I'll give myself until Friday (12th February) to finish this.

## Stage 3: tqnx.link

I've been sitting on tqnx.link for a little while now, the plan is that this will take the URL shortening properties of my current website and move them to that shorter domain. It will be dedicated to just that purpose and anyone will be able to purchase a short URL for £1.99/month or £11.99/year. So I'm going to use this time to set up that service.

### Why before May?

Well, I'm glad you asked! (Not that you did :laughing:) Come the 1st May, I'll be starting my 4-year course with the Open University for an Honour's Degree in IT. Although the course is part-time (around 16 hours per week), I'll need a job alongside that to sustain myself because my current self-employed venture simply isn't 'cutting the mustard'. Thus, the more I get out of the way now while I have heaps of free time, the less I have to do between my juggling of work and university in May.

Thanks for reading and being **so** patient with me. Things are returning to 'normal', however slowly. Please check back in about a week for an update on my progress!
