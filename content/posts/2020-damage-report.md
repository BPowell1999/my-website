Hey everyone - 2020 is coming to an end, 2021 is on it's way, and I have some explaining to do.

I haven't maintained my website for almost a month. My Twitter account has been axed and the name of my blog has been changed, among other things.

![Damage Report "Damage Report"](/images/damage-report.jpg)

I'm not going to dance around the issues here, I'm going to be direct and I intend to spill everything on my mind, so if you're sensitive to (potential) mental-health subjects, this is *not* a post you should read. Additionally, I've been called an attention seeker and a liar and my vulnerability has been exploited already so if that's your plan - **save your breath**.

Okay, so, with that said - 2020 has absolutely *sucked* for me. A lot has happened and it's changed me in ways that I'm still discovering. Not all of them good.

## Employment and work

I've been looking for work now since I failed my college course in 2016. I failed there because I was attending an IT course, but I didn't have a computer myself & I couldn't afford one. As a result, I couldn't keep up with the assignments I was being given, and my tutors weren't helping me. They were telling me half-truths and they were not accepting of my inability to complete assignments - "stop making excuses" or "just use the library" they'd say, and I was but there just wasn't enough time.

Since this, I've had one apprenticeship as a railway technician, however, that particular industry requires something called a sponsor. A sponsor is a contracting firm or employer who's responsible for your training and safety while working. You are not allowed onto a worksite without a sponsor, or at least, in 2016/2017 this is how it worked. After my initial apprenticeship, which in itself *did not* go smoothly (the company refused to give me and a selection of others a test for our passing grade because **they** assigned us to a separate job on their premises at the day the others took the test), the company also refused to support any of the apprentices I worked with and myself to find or get into a work contract. Without any experience and limited PPE, most of us had studied and qualified for the industry, but we were then stonewalled from entering the industry as workers. Our working theory was that the company was just after the government grant from our qualifications with the apprenticeship and gave no monkeys what happened after that.

Since then, I've attended dozens of courses like customer service, warehousing operations, counterbalance & reach truck operations, manufacturing and many, many more trying to upskill and make myself more suitable for work - to no avail. I've also been to dozens of job interviews and I'm always told one of four things:

1. "We are looking for employees with more experience",
2. "We don't feel you're a good fit for our team at this time",
3. "We're sorry, but on this occasion your application was unsuccessful" with no explanation of any kind, or;
4. "...." Absolutely nothing. I usually don't hear back from prospective employers *at all*.

Of course, I have had some other jobs in the interim, for example in June, I was working as a replenishment operative in a warehouse. I was offered a permanent position there which I accepted, and my performance was complimented, just 2 days later I got a phone call in the morning saying that I was never to go in to the warehouse again, totally out of left field. According to the employment contract, they could do this because I had been there 29 days. If I had been there more than 30 days, they'd have to give me 3 months notice to leave. Coincidence? :thinking:

Additionally, in September of 2018, I went to a door factory to work as a forklift operator, however, they took my information and then just stuck me on the end of a production machine. I had no idea what it was, how it worked or what I was supposed to do and they gave me the safety information or told me I had to make arrangements for food or anything like that. I made a complaint and was just ignored, so I walked out.

Honestly, I've reached the point now that I don't want a job that doesn't want me. It's an arrogant attitude but I don't care. I've spent so long trying to be what everyone else wants me to be, and that still isn't good enough so screw everyone else.

## Mental health

As the end of this year has trudged ever closer, I've been noticing signs that perhaps I've been suffering with something. I don't know what it could be and I could always be wrong, but there are definitely signs of something. I have next to no motivation for everything, basic daily tasks, working on my website and much more; plus my emotions are all over the place. I can cry for hours and not know why or I can be ecstatic for no apparent reason just as suddenly. Conveying my emotions to people used to be so easy, but now, the words just don't present themselves when I want to explain my feelings.

The tipping point for me realising this came after my business partnership had to be disbanded suddenly in August 2020 due to my partner misusing funds intended to pay the rent for the business office, following which I became self-employed and spent a month or more working on [The Laptop Project](/projects/tlp) which was intended to help people and I was deeply passionate about - and then when it was published, **nobody cared**. I was incredibly dishearted by this, it was like taking a powerful punch square in the liver.

At this point, I've reached out to two doctors for support and been labelled an attention seeker and a liar, plus I've reached out to my self-employment coach and all three of them were unwilling to help. I don't know where to go or what to do from here.

## Taking a break

As you may have noticed, I took a break over the holiday season. My hope was that it'd help, but it didn't. I deleted my Twitter simply because I didn't use it and I wanted to focus on my website itself (eventually, apparently).

I don't know why I made this post, I don't expect anything good will come of it but I guess I'll find out soon.
