Hey guys! Today I’ve got a review for a game called Space Engineers.

Space Engineers is a game available via Steam for only around £15 – and to be quite frank, I’m addicted already :laughing: I discovered it when digging through the Steam store for something new to play because of burnout with the rest of my library. It was sitting in my Discovery Queue, recommended because I played Star Trek Online.

In the game, there are three distinct modes – Survival, Creative and Storytelling. I’ll start by explaining Survival, and then I’ll explain the differences between it and the other 2 modes.

In Survival mode, you begin by being presented a Spawn Menu – your options are to spawn on Earth, the Moon, Mars, Europa, Titan or an Alien Planet inside a spacecraft called a drop-pod – or if you’re feeling really stubborn, you can spawn in space with no vehicle – just your space suit.

Whichever spawn point you choose, you’ll be given three basic tools – a welder, used to build and repair blocks for things like spacecraft and stations, a grinder which is used to destroy blocks, and a drill, which is used to mine asteroids or the ground of a planet and collect resources.

Your drop-pod (if you spawned with one) will contain a Survival Kit which can recharge your health, energy and gas levels (Oxygen and Hydrogen), an O2/H2 generator to supply the kit, an Ore Detector to highlight nearby resources on the HUD, an Antenna to convey that info to the player and show the pod’s position, and finally - a battery to power it all. Additionally, the drop-pod contains one Hydrogen and four Atmospheric Thrusters which can’t be controlled by default, meaning it provides a good platform for modifications.

Your objective from there is simple, to survive. How you do so is up to you. Some resources like Uranium (required to power Reactors) are only available in space, so reaching Space is a good idea. Space is also easier for ships to fly within because they don’t need to counteract Gravity, however, planets contain higher concentrations of common resources like Iron, Nickel, Cobalt, and crucially Ice – so acquiring them is much easier. Plus, losing oxygen and dying is a major risk in space that most planets don't present. The catch is, you’ll need a ship specifically designed to handle the gravity and even be able to escape it while weighed down by cargo such as resources or components for a new space station.

Wanna build a ground-based fortress and be based on a planet? Go ahead! Wanna live in your drop-pod the whole time? That’s your choice, too. Wanna build your own ship or buy one from NPC engineers? You can choose that too! How you wanna survive is entirely up to you.

That brings me to Creative mode. In creative mode, your character is invulnerable, power-producing blocks like Hydrogen engines can run without fuel, thrusters don’t need power or fuel delivered to them, batteries charge instantly and don’t drain, parachutes can fire without actually having parachutes in the hatch, reactors can produce power without uranium, character flight is unlimited, blocks don’t need to be built with a welder, spectator (free) camera is enabled and more.

Finally, storytelling mode. Storytelling mode is an interesting one, there are a few default scenarios, but most can be downloaded from the Steam Workshop and have been created by other users. These scenarios are more scripted than survival or creative, and usually tell a story of some kind (hence the name of the mode). The default scenarios act as semi-tutorial(*ish*) things, giving some **very** rudimentary information on how to play.

I’ll see you in another few weeks with my next post :smile: I hope some of you enjoy the game​
