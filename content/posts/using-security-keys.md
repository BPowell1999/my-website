Hey everyone! Today I wanna discuss something you’ve probably heard and seen a lot about, 2-factor authentication. I highly recommend that you enable some kind of 2-factor authentication because there’s been a lot of data leaks in recent years.

Today I’m also going to do something slightly different to my usual post style – I’m going to show you how to do this with Windows (to a degree) and Linux.

This post is also going to be quite long, so I’ve broken it down into 3 sections (you can click any of these links to skip to that heading):

1. [Supporting log in with online services in Windows](https://bpowell.net/?p=587&preview=true#online-windows)
2. [Supporting log in with online services in Linux](https://bpowell.net/?p=587&preview=true#online-linux)
3. [Requiring a Security key to log in to Linux desktop](https://bpowell.net/?p=587&preview=true#desktop)
