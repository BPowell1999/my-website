For those of you who haven’t seen my previous posts about S-City Tech, that used to be a business partnership between myself & my best friend of around 15 years. It was a tech-based business that focused a lot on Linux.

We often bought damaged phones, computers, laptops, etc and repaired them, then sold the repaired units. We also offered a network-based Advertisement blocker that worked with any device connected to the same WiFi, be-it a phone, computer or smart TV.

By the time you read this post, S-City Tech’s website and social media profiles will have been skeletonised or closed down entirely.

This was actually caused by my aforementioned friend essentially stealing money from the business that was intended to pay the rent for our office, which, incidentally was left unpaid.

Furthermore, he wasn’t helping with the affairs of the business anymore and even before I found out about the stolen money he wasn’t helping to pay for anything in the partnership.

Just as icing on the cake, he was also using our corporate Instagram account for his own means in sending direct messages and comments to users, some of which were unprofessional, and following his own personal account and those of his friends which were completely unrelated to our business in every way – presumably in an attempt to inflate their numbers.

As a result of all of that, to be quite frank, I didn’t want to work with him anymore… I didn’t want a frenemy like that. So, now we’ve parted ways in both our professional & personal lives.
