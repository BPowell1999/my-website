Hey everyone;

Today, as promised in [/posts/2020-damage-report] I'd like to announce that I've created TQNX.link, a dedicated URL-shortening site.

Some of the long-time readers amongst you will know that a while ago, my website had a copy of YOURLS installed which I had to disable to switch my website to running on Netlify (which it doesn't anymore). 

You can purchase a 3-month (90-day) pass from my [store sub-site](https://store.tequenikality.net). When purchasing your pass, please make sure to add the URL you want to be shortened into your purchase notes at checkout.

In time, more products will be added to my store, but for now the selection is a little bit thin.

Sorry this post is a little short, please stay tuned for further updates. Thanks for reading :smile:
