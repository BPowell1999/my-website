Hi guys! So as I discussed in [a previous post](/posts/eating-my-words/), I was on-the-fence about bothering with Linux when I built my new machine (this one) – but *oh my life* I’m **sooo** glad I held out.

It might surprise you to know the reason I use Linux isn’t *necessarily* because I ‘love’ it. Sorry to break it to you, but it’s an OS. It runs programs. Big whoop. But is, in fact, because I hate the way Windows works (or doesn’t in most cases). Especially Windows 10.

Take today for example. Let’s list the problems I’ve had in Windows 10 just today – bearing in mind I’ve only been awake 7 hours and for most of that I’ve been watching TV in Kodi or working on my companies website (both via Linux), so only a small portion of those 7 hours has actually been on Windows.

1. Sound. I don’t know what it is with Windows, but there *always* seems to be something going wrong with the sound. Whether it’s crackling that doesn’t happen in Linux or a config problem or limitation, there’s always **something**. With me, Windows seems to change my mixer levels all the time. I started up Spotify to listen in the background while I played a quick game but I couldn’t hear Spotify, it took me a few minutes to discover that it was turned all the way down in the mixer :roll_eyes:
2. Updates. Windows update is **infuriating**. I can be playing games or trying to download something, and suddenly, my CPU usage will skyrocket and my network will slow to a crawl – making games unplayable and causing downloads to fail. Why on earth does Windows update use that much CPU when I can play games with Spotify and a browser open in the background without issue?
3. Windows Store. *Yeah* – I’m not even gonna go there. Just **stop**, Microsoft. It isn't working.
4. Performance overhead. In Windows, sitting on the desktop with **ALL** startup apps **DISABLED** and just after a fresh restart, CPU usage sits between 4% and 6% – which doesn’t sound like much, but my local Linux install sometimes doesn’t even register usage under the same circumstances. 0%-2% usage. And how on earth does doing *nothing* and having all apps closed shortly after a restart require 5GB of memory? What are you doing Microsoft? :roll_eyes: I can go on and on and on about why Windows sucks but I think you get the point so I’ll see you in my soon-upcoming post!
