Hey guys! So, today I wanna talk about why I’m not enjoying games as much as I used to anymore. I can feel the ‘boomer’ and ‘get good’ remarks already :laughing:

Let’s take CoD: Warzone as an example. I played that game quite a lot a few weeks after it came out, but recently I’ve been running into **a lot** of players who take the game *wayyy* too seriously. In my opinion, part of an FPS (first-person **shooter**) game is that you *shoot people* and *get shot yourself*, and just move on – it’s a regular occurrence and it’s the whole idea of the game.

A lot of people don’t seem to share this opinion. Particularly in Warzone, if I kill someone in pre-match and they didn’t like how I got a good sniper shot or something they’ll chase me all throughout the the entirety of the actual match and most of my firefights are with one specific player and their squad through the entire match because they didn’t like that I killed them. It *completely* ruins the game when everywhere you go the same squad is always chasing you and parachuting on your head.

But this has happened in other games, too. When Battlefield 4 came out I was in secondary school. I remember playing that long after I left school, but when several other Battlefield games came out and the more casual players (like me) move on to something new, it leaves these toewrags who take vendetta’s against you whenever you get a cheeky headshot with a sniper or a decent flank and kill them from behind.

This is actually why I stopped buying CoD games after MW3, because that was another try-hard infested title. It really was an awesome game but the people who take it so seriously just ruin it *all the time*. CoD is notorious for it, but it’s far from the only franchise with this problem.

Apex Legends is another decent example, I played that game on *launch day* but within a month it was essentially unplayable because so many people took it so damn seriously and took all the fun out of it.

I’m not going to sit here and rattle off a long list of games I don’t like – I’m not that boring, but that’s the general gist. Let me know if you feel the same way!
