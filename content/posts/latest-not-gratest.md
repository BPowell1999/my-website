Hey everyone; today I wanna talk about something that's popped up recently with the release of lot's of high-profile technologies like the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nvidia's 3000-series graphics cards, and more expected soon from AMD and Intel and *much* more - and that's the idea of having "the latest and greatest" techno-gadgets. 

But here's the thing; **ALL** of those things are created and distributed by *people*, without exception. Granted, they are really smart people that have intricate specialist knowledge of matters like material science, software engineering and logistics - but people nonetheless. As a result of this, they are subject to making mistakes - look no further than Microsoft's Xbox 360 from a few years ago to see that.

Let's think about it logically; why does everything from computers to smartphones to cars and even IoT devices like toasters need software updates? Because *people* made that device and it's software and there are flaws in it, which leads to a missing feature or a security exploit, that is then *fixed* retroactively via an update.

What I'm trying to say is, let's not forget how complicated these devices really are - there are bound to be some initial growing pains. Whether it's Nvidia's capacitor problems, PS5's coil whine, Xbox One X's loose screw, etc. These aren't world-ending fundamental flaws - they're just growing pains. Don't forget that around **half** of the original Xbox 360 consoles failed, and yet there are plenty of people who hail that as their favourite console.

Thanks for reading! I'll see you soon in my next post.
