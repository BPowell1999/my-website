## Important Information

_**The recent switch to HUGO has rendered some information in this post outdated and inaccurate. However, it contains other pertinent information, so I chose not to remove it.**_

Hi guys… Okay – heads up, this post might be difficult for me, so please bear with my rambling. I will get the point across eventually.

The reason I’m making this post is because there’s been weeks or months between my recent posts, and in most of them I say “Sorry for the low content volume, more is coming” and then it doesn’t. The delay continues.

I really lose my patience quickly with people who continuously do things even though they apologise for it most of the time – just ask my ex-fiance. So, I’m going to practice what I preach. My aim with this post is to own up to my shortcomings and failings with this website *and* my Twitter account, and make some commitments to resolve them.

The first thing I want to do is let you in on some of the behind-the-scenes details that I haven’t released before – it shows I haven’t been completely bone-idle. I haven’t done as much as I could have and we’ll get into that, but there are things that have happened.

First of all, my website has undergone a lot of technical changes. There’s now a reCaptcha integrated with the sign up form to curb spam signups, new security suites have been integrated, you can now use 2-factor authentication and sign in with your WordPress.com credentials, there’s a store present now (my next post will be all about that), my URL-S project has been restarted and I have a new project in the works (more details of this also in my next post).

So, I’ve not been entirely bone-idle. However, that said, I’m not excused either. There is plenty of times I could’ve sat and written a short post about something, but I simply haven’t had the motivational drive to do so and when I have, I haven’t been able to think of a topic to write about.

That brings me to what I want to do about it. Well, starting from my next post (so **not** including this one), I’m going to set myself a deadline. I’m going to post *at least* once per two weeks. As time goes on and I eventually get my mindset back on track, I’ll increase that to once per week, and then eventually twice per week and so on.

I’m also going to make an effort to keep you more informed about what projects are going on behind-the-scenes because as you’ll see in my next post, I’ve failed miserably at that so far :laughing:

#### Closing notes

I just want to say a big “thank you” to the people that regularly read my rambling and are still here in spite all of my shortfalls – **thank you!** I hope that your patience with me will pay off for you one day and I’m working to do better for you guys.
