Hey everyone; today I have some good news :relaxed:

After lot's of hard work and planning, my new project TLP is ready for action! At the time of writing, 2 units are *already* available. I'm looking into advertising for consumers and partnerships for procurement and distribution, and I'm also contacting some institutes to see if they are interested in this project.

For a full breakdown of the project; or to apply for a unit or partnership, please see [the dedicated project page](/projects/tlp).
