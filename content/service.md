### IMPORTANT INFORMATION

*This statement applies to several works, not all of which belong to me. These include;*

- [Tequenikality](/) (This website)
- [Luxotic](luxoticlingerieandswimwear.com) (Hosted on my server; [contact the owner](mailto:info@luxoticlingerieandswimwear.com))

**_Collectively, 'the works'_**.

---

Services I render are enabled in large part by [Dynu](https://dynu.com). They provide domain registration & management, email and dynamic domain resolution services as well as a virtual private server. Their Privacy Policy is available [here](https://www.dynu.com/en-US/Legal/PrivacyPolicy). Additionally, [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) provide the SSL certification for the works within this statement.

Hosting of the works is accomplished with a combination of my own server and the VPS rented from Dynu.

[Tequenikality](https://tequenikality.net) is built and rendered using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) with a customised version of the theme [Hermit by Track3](https://github.com/Track3/hermit) installed. The original license is available [here](/Hermit.LICENSE).

[Luxotic](https://luxoticlingerieandswimwear.com) is built and rendered using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org). For any additional information, please refer to the website.

Within [Tequenikality](https://tequenikality.net), data may be shared between my website and my payment processor ([Square](https://squareup.com)) - their Privacy Policies can be located [here](https://squareup.com/gb/en/legal/general/privacy) and [here](https://squareup.com/gb/legal/privacy-no-account).

Within other hosted works, all data is accessible to the representative with whom I work and their associates. Otherwise, I do not share data with anyone. However, the representative or their associates may choose to do so. For more information, please see the privacy policy of the works in question.

I take all actions within my power to keep data related to any and all works within my server secure. The VPS rented from Dynu is configured identically to my own server, thus all the same security measures are in place.
