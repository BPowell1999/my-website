## About Me

I’m just a simple guy from Sheffield (England) looking to share my opinion, help some people and make friends online. I sell some items on [eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/bpowell1999), and I post my thoughts & opinions from time to time.

I’m always open to feedback on my website and services, or just for a chat! Don’t hesitate to get in touch through my social media accounts (linked below) if you have anything to say :smile:

## About My Website

My website is built using the [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) Static-Site Generator. The theme I'm using ([Hermit by Track3](https://github.com/Track3/hermit)) is licensed under MIT. The original licenses is available [here](/Hermit.LICENSE).

My website *is not* open source; I *(Brandon Powell)* am the **exclusive** copyright holder. However, you can contribute on [GitHub](/github) if you see errors on my site or would like to suggest a change. Additionally, as-per [GitHub's TOS](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service), you **can** fork my repository and create derivative works, *so long as* said works *do not* violate my rights under copyright law. This includes (**but _is not_ limited to**) acts such as redistributing my **unmodified** work, suggesting being my original website and plagiarising posts and/or pages.

Derivative works **do not** need to accredit me in any way, track changes or choose any specific license, *under the condition that my rights are not violated*.
